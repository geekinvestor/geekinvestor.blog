Today I sold my [CGC.TO](https://www.google.com/finance?q=TSE:CGC) at price 13.06, while I bought it with 3.98. The revenue is not bad for me with return of about 3 times. The 52 weeks high is 17.86. If I was able to sell it at that price, I will make 2000 more.

So why did I sell it? Because apparently it's overbought now.
